# Miscellaneous

Notes and stuff I'm posting publicly

* [Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs](proxmoxVE71/README.md) ... many pages, very verbose
* [TrueNAS Scale 22.02 and Passing Through a Single GPU](TrueNAS_Scale_driverctl.md) ... 1 page tech note

Something to know ... I write a LOT of notes. These notes are meant to be useful for me to remember my processes perhaps years later when I have forgotten a step I took. That means these aren't *short* guides. Hopefully they will help another user with figuring out not just how to do ... but why it was done.

## TMI:

*Why do I (the author) need notes at this level?*

*Doesn't it take WAY too long?*

... 20 years ago I'd have agreed that I'm taking **way too long** writing everything down. 

... 10 years ago I would have wanted more notes but been too interested in getting things running to bother. 

But today things are different. Why?

* Watching both of my parents falling into dementia (father was a DBA and Unix toolchain coder who can barely use a web browser now)
* My 50+ year old brain slowing down

Also has something to do with having a career in Technical Marketing / Sales Engineering / Project Management. While I'm no longer working (medical spine stuff, which contributes to memory issues) I still prefer to make everything as documented as I can.
