# Miscellaneous

Notes and stuff I'm posting publicly

* [TrueNAS Scale 22.02 and Passing Through a Single GPU](TrueNAS_Scale_driverctl.md)
* [Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs](proxmoxVE71/README.md)

Something to know ... I write a LOT of notes. These notes are meant to be useful for me to remember my processes perhaps years later when I have forgotten a step I took. That means these aren't *short* guides. Hopefully they will help another user with figuring out not just how to do ... but why it was done. 

*Should I need notes at this level?*

*Doesn't it take WAY too long?*

20 years ago I'd have agreed. 10 years ago I would have wanted more notes but been too interested in getting things running to bother. But ... between watching both of my parents fall into dementia (father was a DBA and Unix toolchain coder who can barely use a web browser now) along with my 50+ year old brain slowing down ... I wanted more documentation!

Probably also has something to do with having a career in Technical Marketing / Sales Engineering / Project Management. While I'm no longer working (medical stuff, which contributes to my own memory issues) I still prefer to make everything as documented as I can easily do.
