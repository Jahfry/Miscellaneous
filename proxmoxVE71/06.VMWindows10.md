# Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs - 06 - VM Windows 10

This is the process for getting a basic Windows 10 VM installed on Proxmox with GPU passthrough. 

**NOTES:**

* This is a BASIC setup, just to get one running. 
* Any tuning to the VM for performance will be in a later page.
* VMs using PCIE Passthrough can't be migrated to another machine (*maybe* if the other machine is identical, can't test) using Proxmox Cluster services.

## 06.B. Upload ISOs to Proxmox

Proxmox recently added a feature to directly upload .iso files, including from a remote host without intermediate downloads. 

* Log in to the Proxmox web UI
* Go to 'Datacenter' > [your hostname] > 'local (your hostname)' (this is the storage device under the host) > 'ISO Images' (in the middle column)

### 06.B.i. Windows 10 ISO

To upload the main ISO, Open [this Microsoft page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) (in another tab/window).

* *Option 1:* If using Linux PC, Mac or mobile device you can get a link directly to an ISO image that contains multiple Windows 10 editions (21H2 is around 5.8GB), *skipping the need to download to your PC first and then upload to Proxmox.* This may also work on a Windows PC but, if not, see next option. 
    + Click through the options until you get a "Download" link
    + Copy the URL for that link
    + In Proxmox 'ISO Images' click 'Download from URL'
    + 'URL:' > Paste in the iso link
    + Click 'Query URL' to fill out 'File name:' (you can modify the filename)
    + Click 'Download' in the Proxmox UI
    + When you see 'TASK OK' in the pop-up, click the 'X' on the pop-up to close it (not the main browser tab)
* *Option 2:* If browsing from a Windows machine you *may* (I'm not able to test whether this page redirects you) have to use the "Media Creation Tool", download the .iso to your machine, and then upload it to Proxmox via these steps. One possible advantage to this is you can get an image for a specific edition of Windows 10, which lowers the file size by <>1GB (almost 5GB instead of almost 6GB). 
    + Download the Media Creation Tool
    + Run through it until you can select the option to download a .iso, wait for the download to complete.
    + 'File:' > select the file from your PC
    + *optional*: Edit the filename (like 'Win10-64bit-21H2-Pro.iso')
    + Click 'Upload' in the Proxmox UI
    + When you see 'TASK OK' in the pop-up, click the 'X' on the pop-up to close it (not the main browser tab)

### 06.B.ii. VirtIO Drivers

* Go to the [official site](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/) (in another tab/window). 
    + Decide if you want the Stable or Latest drivers (I pick Stable unless I know otherwise). 
    + Click whichever you chose (they *can* be on the same version). 
    + Copy the link address for 'virtio-win-[version number].iso' to your clipboard
        - at time of writing, this was 'virtio-win-0.1.217.iso', but look for newer stable
        - you can copy the link for 'virtio-win.iso' without a version number in it
        - they're the same file, but having the version number may be better so you can have different versions available or easily know when there is a newer version available
    + In Proxmox 'ISO Images' click 'Download from URL'
    + 'URL:' > Paste in the iso link
    + Click 'Query URL' to fill out 'File name:' (you can modify the filename, for instance to add the version if you copied the link without version in the name)
    + Click 'Download' in the Proxmox UI
    + When you see 'TASK OK' in the pop-up, click the 'X' on the pop-up to close it (not the main browser tab)

## 06.C. Create the VM

**IMPORTANT:** I'm not saying these settings are optimal. Only that they worked. I'll walk through all options. [The Proxmox Wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_10_guest_best_practices) has more information about what is done below. 

### 06.C.i Initial VM Settings

* In the Proxmox UI, click "Create VM"
* 'General'
    + 'Node:' = your Proxmox hostname. If you have multiple nodes, you should already know which to pick. Default otherwise.
    + 'VM Id:' = default ("100" if this the first VM)
    + 'Name:' = "Win10-VFIO" (can be whatever you want)
        - Dashes "-" and Underscores "_" are ok as long as the first and last character are alpanumeric.
        - No spaces/etc. Must be valid as a DNS hostname (even though wiki says this is a freeform input)
        - Other systems (TrueNAS) with very long names caused namespace problems, keep it short but understandable
    + 'Resource Pool:' = {empty} (we haven't set any) [[wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/User_Management#pveum_resource_pools)]
    + 'Advanced' (checkbox at bottom) = {unchecked} (or use to set the VM to start at boot if wanted)
* 'OS'
    + {radio selector} = "Use CD/DVD disc image file (iso)"
        - 'Storage' = "local" (we haven't set up others)
        - 'ISO Image' = click the Windows 10 ISO image from before
    + 'Type:' = "Microsoft Windows"
    + 'Version:' = '10/2016/2019' ('10' is Windows 10, '2016' is Windows Server 2016, '2019' is Windows Server 2019 ... 11/2022 is for Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022)
* 'System'
    + 'Graphic card:' = "VirtIO-GPU"
    + 'Machine:' = "q35"
    + 'BIOS:' = "OVMF (UEFI)"
    + 'Add EFI Disk:' = {checked} (default)
    + 'EFI Storage:' = "local-zfs" (puts the image on the boot drive, we haven't added other storage yet)
    + 'Format:' = {disabled}
    + 'Pre-Enroll keys:' = {checked} (default)
    + 'SCSI Controller:' = "VirtIO SCSI"
    + 'Qemu Agent:' = {checked}
    + 'Add TPM:' = {NOT checked} (default) ... this can prevent Windows 11 upgrade nags and can be enabled later on. 
* 'Disks'
    + 'Bus/Device:' = "VirtIO Block" "0"
        - Proxmox wiki and other guides suggest "SCSI" here, safe to change if preferred
        - [Recent discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/tyiorg/ryzen_gpupci_usb_passthrough_advanced/) that has me trying Block instead of SCSI
    + 'SCSI Controller:' = {disabled input, value is "VirtIO SCSI Single"} (set on 'System' tab)
    + 'Storage:' = local-zfs (default, also set on 'System' tab)
    + 'Disk size (GiB):' = 50 (Windows recommended min, feel free to change, I'm attaching a dedicated 1GB NVME later for apps/games)
    + 'Format:' = {disabled input}
    + 'Cache:' = "write back" 
        - *not* "write back (unsafe)"
        - if you don't have a UPS, use "none"
        - Old thread reports "none" is actually faster, so worth a test anyway, later
    + 'Discard:' = {checked}
    + 'Advanced' (checkmark at bottom) = {checked}
    + 'SSD Emulation:' = {disabled} ... if using "SCSI" instead of "VirtIO Block" it will be enabled, {check} this
    + 'IO thread:' = {checked} ... won't have much effect currently, may help later if adding more disks
    + 'Read-only:' = {unchecked} (default)
    + 'Backup:' = {checked} (default)
    + 'Skip replication:' = {unchecked} (default) ... not using replication currently anyway
    + 'Async IO:' = "Default (io_uring)" (default)
* 'CPU'
    + 'Sockets:' = "1" (default)
    + 'Cores:' = "8" ... note, this is on a 5950X with 16 cores, adjust as needed
    + 'Type:' = "host"
        - "host" passes the Host CPU as-is, which locks this VM to this type of CPU unless changed, giving full feature set
        - "Default (kvm64)" works, especially if you want to move this VM to a different type of CPU later, uses Pentium 4 instructions
        - Using Debian Bullseye + Brave browser I was unable to scroll the list to see "host"
        - You can type in the field (ie, type "host" in the field then select from the drop-down)
     + 'Advanced' {checkbox} = unchecked
* 'Memory'
     + 'Memory (MiB):' = 32768 ... 32GiB, adjust to what you want based on your total RAM
     + 'Advanced' {checkbox} = *checked*
     + 'Minimum memory (MiB):' = 32768
     + 'Shares:' = {disabled}
     + 'Ballooning Device:' = *unchecked* ... causes issues with Windows VMs and isn't good for some applications (like games)
* 'Network'
     + 'No network device' {checkbox} = unchecked
     + 'Bridge:' = "vmbr0"
     + 'VLAN Tag:' = {empty} (shows "No VLAN" but don't type that)
     + 'Firewall:' = {checked} (default)
     + 'Model:' = "VirtIO (paravirtualized" ... if problems use E1000
     + 'MAC address:' = empty (shows "auto" but don't type that)
     + 'Advanced' {checkbox} = {unchecked}
* 'Confirm' ... click "Finish"
* Select the new VM in the left column. If you used the settings above as-is, it will be named "100 (Win10-VFIO)"
* *Optional Sidebar:* Notice the "Summary" view has a "Notes" widget
    + You don't *need* to do anything here
    + It's very handy to document whatever you need
    + Markdown syntax is accepted
    + Click the gear icon on the right of this widget and paste in this to bookmark the guide you're using:  
        > \*\*Setup Guide:\*\* \[Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs\](https://github.com/Jahfry/Miscellaneous/tree/main/proxmoxVE71)
    + (edit to whatever you want, that's just an example of markdown formatting with a link)
* Click 'Hardware' in the middle column

### 06.C.ii VM Hardware: Add VirtIO iso CD-ROM

This will allow a second ISO to be used during first boot that contains the VirtIO drivers.

* (if needed, go back to VM 'Hardware')
* Click "Add" and select "CD/DVD Drive"
    + 'Bus/Device:' = "IDE" "0" (default ... note that "2" should be the Win10 install ISO we set up earlier)
    + {radio selector} = "Use CD/DVD disc image file (iso)"
        - 'Storage:' = "local"
        - 'ISO image:' = "virtio-win-0.1.217.uso" ... select the virtio ISO you uploaded earlier, filename may be different ("virtio-win.iso" or a different version if newer was available)
    + "Create"

### 06.D.iii VM Hardware: Add GPU

Pass through the GPU (video and audio). Screenshots and more details [here](https://3os.org/infrastructure/proxmox/pgu-passthrough-to-vm/#windows-virtual-machine-gpu-passthrough-configuration). 

* (if needed, go back to VM 'Hardware')
* Click "Add" and select "PCI Device"
    + 'Device:' = "0000:0b:00.0" ... change this to match your hardware, see `iommu_list` from [04.ProxmoxExtras.md](04.ProxmoxExtras.md#04b-useful-utilities)
    + 'All Functions:' = {checked}
    + 'Primary GPU:' = {*unchecked*} (default) ... ([unchecked](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/b5xpua/the_ultimate_beginners_guide_to_gpu_passthrough/) / [checked](https://3os.org/infrastructure/proxmox/pgu-passthrough-to-vm/#windows-virtual-machine-gpu-passthrough-configuration ... figure out which)
    + 'Advanced' {checkbox}
    + 'ROM-Bar:' = {checked}
    + 'PCI-Express:' = {checked}
    + 'Vendor ID:' / 'Device ID:' / 'Sub-Vendor ID:' / 'Sub-Device ID:' = {From Device} (defaults)

## 06.D. Install Windows

This is not detailed on basic Windows 10 installation, but does cover specifics to this VM setup. 

### 06.D.i. Gotchas

*Be aware of these during the installation process:*

* Connect a monitor to your GPU ahead of time to be ready for that step
* Instructions below are based on Windows 10 21H2 ... text for some items may vary with other versions
* When instructions below say '>_ Console' in the "middle column" it means **don't** use the blue '>_ Console' button in the top-right of the Proxmox UI
    + The middle-column option embeds the viewer in the Proxmox UI window
    + The top-right button uses a pop-up window
        - Install media CD boot option expires quickly
        - On some browsers (at least on my low resolution Debian laptop) the pop-up viewer has an issue the window constantly moves across the screen and if maximized (to stop movement) the screen flashes instead. 
* If you need to restart the VM during install the Proxmox UI can't do a quick "Shutdown" due to the VM not have ACPI or VirtIO active during the installer (this shouldn't be a common problem after initial install is finished)
    + The host is locking the VM
        - Often this is the Proxmox UI / Console viewer for the VM
        - *Giving it time may work* but can go 5-10 minutes before timeout and can still fail
    + If that doesn't work, or you don't want to wait, open a shell to the host as root and:
        - `qm stop 100`
            * Replace 100 with whatever # your VM is on
            * If unsure, `cat /etc/pve/.vmlist` but the same info is in the UI
            * This probably also fails, basically the same as using the UI
        - `fuser /run/lock/qemu-server/lock-100.conf` ... change "100" if needed)
            > /run/lock/qemu-server/lock-200.conf: #####  
          "#####" is a process number, replace in the next 2 lines with the number you get in the command above
        - `ps #####` ... to see what the process is
        - `kill -9 #####` ... be SURE you use the right number here
        - `qm stop 100` ... should work now

### 06.D.ii Installation

* Start the VM with VNC Console
    + '>_ Console' from the *middle column* (not the button on top-right) of "100 (Win10-VFIO)" in Proxmox UI
        - The main window should say "Guest not running / Start Now"
    + Click 'Start Now'
    + ***Press a key*** *as soon as you see 'Press any key to boot from CD or DVD ..." 
        - This goes away fairly fast (why we don't use the '>_ Console' button on top-right)
        - If it goes away before you press a key, you'll go through network PXE boot followed by an EFI shell. Wait for the EFI shell and do a `reboot`
        - You can optimize boot process in BIOS (`exit` the EFI shell) but it isn't needed as long as you press a key in time during initial boot 
* 'Install Now'
    + 'Which type of installation' = "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" (not "Upgrade:")
    + 'Where do you want to install Windows?' = "Load driver" (no disk detected yet)
    + 'Load Driver' = "OK" (not "Browse", will use the "virtio-win10" ISO)
    + 'Select the driver to install' = "Red Hat VirtIO SCSI controller (D:\amd6w1viostor.inf)" > "Next"
    + 'Where do you want to install Windows?' = "Drive 0 Unallocated Space" > "Next"
    + *Continue Windows installation as normal* ***until:***
        - 'Let's connect you to a network' = "I don't have internet" ... (VirtIO network driver not yet installed)
        - 'There's more to discover wen you connect to the internet' = "Continue with limited setup"
    + *Finish Windows installation as normal*
* Log in to the Windows desktop

### 06.D.iii VirtIO drivers

VirtIO SCSI driver is already loaded but we still need others. Choose one of these methods to install the Virtio drivers (these are all done in the VM):

1. *Wizard-based install of multiple drivers at a time* (initially faster, may waste some space)

* File Explorer > 'This PC' > 'CD Drive (D:) virtio-win'
* Run (double-click) 'virtio-win-gt-x64'
    + It should be fine to accept all drivers listed, but "X Entire feature will be unavailable" and you want to exclude
        - Windows will only load if needed
        - FYI: "pvpanic", "ivshem" and others may not be signed [per this](https://kevinlocke.name/bits/2021/12/10/windows-11-guest-virtio-libvirt/) 

2. *Individual Driver Installation* (only installs what you need)

* Open 'Device Manager' > 'Other Devices' > 'Ethernet Controller'
    + right-click > 'Update driver' > 'Browse my computer for drivers'
    + 'Search for drivers in this location:' = "D:\" 
        - 'Include subfolders' = {checked}
        - 'Next'
* When done, Windows prompts about network discovery in a pop-up, allow (unless you want sharing off)
* If you have an active Internet connection on 'vmbr1', Windows will likely automatically download and enable your GPU, giving pop-up announcing Nvidia driver installed
    + if no internet connection on VM, get the driver installer to the VM and run it manually
* Repeat 'Update driver' above for each device that is still marked with a "!" in device manager
    + You may not have any devices left once Windows does auto-updates
    + If you passthrough other devices in the future, come back to Device Manager to Update drivers
    + You won't need to do this for VirtIO devices if you use Method 1. above
