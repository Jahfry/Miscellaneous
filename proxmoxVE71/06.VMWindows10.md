# Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs - 06 - VM Windows 10

***Not complete pending updates to 05 Proxmox GPU Passthrough page***

This is the process for getting a Windows 10 VM installed on Proxmox with VirtIO drivers, qemu guest agent, and GPU passthrough. This assumes you've been following prior pages before getting here. 

**NOTES:**

* This is a BASIC setup, just to get one running. 
* Any tuning to the VM for performance will be in a later page.
* VMs using PCIE Passthrough can't be migrated to another machine (*maybe* if the other machine is identical, can't test) using Proxmox Cluster services. 
* The instructions below are written to attach my RTX 3080TI GPU to the VM, but the GTX 1060 is the one I wrote most about when configuring 'driverctl' in "[05. Proxmox GPU Passthrough](05.ProxmoxGPUPassthrough.md)".
    + I've done the exact same configuration with the GTX 1060 using the following instructions
    + Notes on fixing error "Code 43" for the GTX 1060 are below (the RTX 3080TI didn't need fixes) and aren't related to using 'driverctl' for blacklisting.

## 06.B. Upload ISOs to Proxmox

Proxmox recently added a feature to directly upload .iso files, including from a remote host without intermediate downloads. 

* Log in to the Proxmox web UI
* Go to 'Datacenter' > [your hostname] > 'local (your hostname)' (this is the storage device under the host) > 'ISO Images' (in the middle column)

### 06.B.i. Windows 10 ISO

To upload the main ISO, Open [this Microsoft page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) (in another tab/window).

* ***Option 1:*** If browsing from a Windows machine you will have to use the "Media Creation Tool", download the .iso to your machine, and then upload it to Proxmox via these steps. An advantage to this is you can get an image for a specific edition of Windows 10, which lowers the file size by <>1GB (almost 5GB instead of almost 6GB). 
    + *On the Windows PC*
	    + Download the 'Media Creation Tool' and run it
	    + Accept 'Applicable notices and license terms'
	    + Select 'Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD or ISO file) for another PC' > 'Next'
	    + *Optional:* Uncheck 'Use the recommended options for this PC' if you want to change the options
	    + 'Next'
	    + Select 'ISO file' > 'Next'
	    + *Optional:* change the filename to be more descriptive (like "Windows10-64-21H2.iso")
	    + Wait for the download to complete
	    + 'Finish'
    + *Proxmox UI*
	    + 'Datacenter' > {your hostname} > 'local ({your hostname})' (storage) > 'ISO Images' (middle column) >   
	       **'ISO Images'** > ***'Upload'***
		+ 'Select File' ... pick the .iso you downloaded with the Media Creation Tool
	    + *Optional*: Edit the filename to be more descriptive
	    + Click 'Upload'
	    + When you see 'TASK OK' in the pop-up, click the 'X' on the pop-up to close

* ***Option 2:*** If using Linux PC, Mac or mobile device you can get a link directly to an ISO image that contains multiple Windows 10 editions (21H2 is around 5.8GB), *skipping the need to download to your PC first and then upload to Proxmox.* 
    + *In your browser* 
	    + Click through the options until you get a "Download" link
	    + Copy the URL for that link to your clipboard
    + *Proxmox UI*
	    + 'Datacenter' > {your hostname} > 'local ({your hostname})' (storage) > 'ISO Images' (middle column) >  
	       **'ISO Images'** > ***'Download from URL'***
	    + 'URL:' > Paste in the iso link from your clipboard
	    + Click 'Query URL' to fill out 'File name:' (you can modify the filename)
	    + Click 'Download' in the Proxmox UI
	    + When you see 'TASK OK' in the pop-up, click the 'X' on the pop-up to close

	
### 06.B.ii. VirtIO Drivers

* Go to one of these links (in another tab/window) ... (they *can* be on the same version):  
	    [stable](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/) (I use this)  
	    **or**  
	    [latest](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/latest-virtio/)
+ Copy the link address for 'virtio-win-{version number}.iso' to your clipboard
	- At time of writing, this was 'virtio-win-0.1.217.iso', but look for newer
	- You can copy the link for 'virtio-win.iso' without a version number in it
		- They're the same file
		- Using the version number is better
			- Can have different versions available
			- Easily know when there is a newer version available

+ *Proxmox UI*
	+ 'Datacenter' > {your hostname} > 'local ({your hostname})' (storage) > 'ISO Images' (middle column) >  
	   **'ISO Images'** > ***'Download from URL'***
    + 'URL:' > Paste in the iso link from your clipboard
    + Click 'Query URL' to fill out 'File name:' ... you can modify the filename (example: add the version if you copied the link without version in the name)
    + Click 'Download' in the Proxmox UI
    + When you see 'TASK OK' in the pop-up, click the 'X' on the pop-up to close it (not the main browser tab)

## 06.C. Create the VM

**IMPORTANT:** I'm not saying these settings are optimal. Only that they worked. I'll walk through all options. [The Proxmox Wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_10_guest_best_practices) has more information about what is done below. 

### 06.C.i. Initial VM Settings

* In the Proxmox UI, click "Create VM"
* 'General'
    + 'Node:' = your Proxmox hostname. If you have multiple nodes, you should already know which to pick. Default otherwise.
    + 'VM Id:' = default ("100" if this the first VM)
    + 'Name:' = "Win10-VFIO" (can be whatever you want)
        - Dashes "-" and Underscores "_" are ok as long as the first and last character are alpanumeric
        - No spaces/etc. Must be valid as a DNS hostname (even though wiki says this is a freeform input)
        - Other systems (TrueNAS) with very long names caused namespace problems, keep it short but understandable
    + 'Resource Pool:' = {empty} (we haven't set any) [[wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/User_Management#pveum_resource_pools)]
    + 'Advanced' (checkbox at bottom) = {unchecked} (or use to set the VM to start at boot if wanted)
* 'OS'
    + {radio selector} = "Use CD/DVD disc image file (iso)"
        - 'Storage' = "local" (we haven't set up others)
        - 'ISO Image' = click the Windows 10 ISO image you uploaded
    + 'Type:' = "Microsoft Windows"
    + 'Version:' = '10/2016/2019' ('10' is Windows 10, '2016' is Windows Server 2016, '2019' is Windows Server 2019 ... 11/2022 is for Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022)
* 'System'
    + 'Graphic card:' = "VirtIO-GPU"
    + 'Machine:' = "q35"
    + 'BIOS:' = "OVMF (UEFI)"
    + 'Add EFI Disk:' = {checked} (default)
    + 'EFI Storage:' = "local-zfs" (puts the image on the boot drive, we haven't added other storage yet)
    + 'Format:' = {disabled}
    + 'Pre-Enroll keys:' = {checked} (default)
    + 'SCSI Controller:' = "VirtIO SCSI"
    + 'Qemu Agent:' = {checked}
    + 'Add TPM:' = {NOT checked} (default) ... this can prevent Windows 11 upgrade nags and can be enabled later on. 
* 'Disks'
    + 'Bus/Device:' = "VirtIO Block" "0"
        - Proxmox wiki and other guides suggest "SCSI" here, safe to change if preferred
        - [Recent discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/tyiorg/ryzen_gpupci_usb_passthrough_advanced/) about  'VirtIO Block' vs 'SCSI'
    + 'Storage:' = local-zfs (default, also set on 'System' tab)
    + 'Disk size (GiB):' = 48 (Windows recommended min, feel free to change, I'm attaching a dedicated 1GB NVME later for apps/games ... 32 is safe if you don't install much to C:\)
    + 'Cache:' = "write back" 
        - *Not* "write back (unsafe)"
        - If you don't have a UPS, use "none" to be safer
        - Old thread I read reports "none" is actually faster, so worth a test anyway, later
    + 'Discard:' = {checked}
    + 'Advanced' (checkmark at bottom) = {checked}
    + 'SSD Emulation:' = {disabled} ... if using "SCSI" instead of "VirtIO Block" it will be enabled, {check} this
    + 'IO thread:' = {checked} ... won't have effect currently, may help later if adding more disks
    + 'Read-only:' = {unchecked} (default)
    + 'Backup:' = {checked} (default)
    + 'Skip replication:' = {unchecked} (default) ... not using replication currently anyway
    + 'Async IO:' = "Default (io_uring)" (default)
* 'CPU'
    + 'Sockets:' = "1" (default)
    + 'Cores:' = "8" ... note, this is on a 5950X with 16 cores, adjust as needed
    + 'Type:' = "host"
        - "host" passes the Host CPU as-is, which locks this VM to this type of CPU unless changed, giving full feature set
        - "Default (kvm64)" works, especially if you want to move this VM to a different type of CPU later, uses Pentium 4 instructions
        - Using Debian Bullseye + Brave browser I was unable to scroll the list to see "host"
	        - You can type in the field 
	        - Example: type "host" in the field then select from the drop-down
     + 'Advanced' {checkbox} = unchecked
* 'Memory'
     + 'Memory (MiB):' = 32768 ... 32GiB, adjust to what you want based on your total RAM
     + 'Advanced' {checkbox} = *checked*
     + 'Ballooning Device:' = *unchecked*
	     + Causes issues with Windows VMs and isn't good for some applications (like games)
	     + Once unchecked 'Minimum memory (MiB)' and 'Shares' no longer allow changes
* 'Network'
     + 'No network device' {checkbox} = unchecked
     + 'Bridge:' = "vmbr1" (created in prior page: [04.C. - Networking](04.ProxmoxExtras.md#04c-networking))
     + 'VLAN Tag:' = {empty} (shows "No VLAN" but don't type that)
     + 'Firewall:' = {checked} (default)
     + 'Model:' = "VirtIO (paravirtualized" 
     + 'MAC address:' = empty (shows "auto" but don't type that)
     + 'Advanced' {checkbox} = {unchecked}
* 'Confirm' ... click "Finish"
* Select the new VM in the left column. If you used the settings above as-is, it will be named "100 (Win10-VFIO)"
* *Optional Sidebar:* Notice the "Summary" view has a "Notes" widget
    + You don't *need* to do anything here
    + It's very handy to document whatever you need
    + Markdown syntax is accepted
    + Click the gear icon on the right of this widget and paste in this to bookmark the guide you're using:  
        > \*\*Setup Guide:\*\* \[Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs\](https://github.com/Jahfry/Miscellaneous/tree/main/proxmoxVE71)
    + (edit to whatever you want, that's just an example of markdown formatting with a link)

**NOTE:** *Assuming you went through [05. Proxmox GPU Passthrough](05.ProxmoxGPUPassthrough.md), this is where you add the 'driverctl' hookscript from [05.D.iii. Attach Hookscript](05.ProxmoxGPUPassthrough.md#05diii-attach-hookscript).* 

* Repeated here to save you going back to that page
* If you followed everything above and this is VM '100':  
	`qm set 100 -hookscript local:snippets/hooksciprt-driverctl.pl`
* If your VM number is different, edit '100' above to match

### 06.C.ii. VM Hardware: Add VirtIO iso CD-ROM

This will allow a second ISO to be used during first boot that contains the VirtIO drivers.

* *Proxmox UI*  
  'Datacenter' > '{your host}' > '100 (Win10-VFIO)' {or whatever you named yours} >  
  **'Hardware' (middle column)**
* Click "Add" and select "CD/DVD Drive"
    + 'Bus/Device:' = "IDE" "0" (default ... note that "2" should be the Win10 install ISO we set up earlier)
    + {radio selector} = "Use CD/DVD disc image file (iso)"
        - 'Storage:' = "local"
        - 'ISO image:' = "virtio-win-0.1.217.uso" ... select the virtio ISO you uploaded earlier, filename may be different ("virtio-win.iso" or a different version if newer was available)
    + "Create"

### 06.C.iii. VM Hardware: Add GPU

* (if needed, go back to VM 'Hardware')
* Click "Add" and select "PCI Device"
    + 'Device:' = "0000:0b:00.0" ... change this to match your hardware, see `iommu_list` from [04.ProxmoxExtras.md](04.ProxmoxExtras.md#04b-useful-utilities)
    + 'All Functions:' = {checked}
    + 'Primary GPU:' = {*unchecked*} (default) ... ([unchecked](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/b5xpua/the_ultimate_beginners_guide_to_gpu_passthrough/) / [checked](https://3os.org/infrastructure/proxmox/pgu-passthrough-to-vm/#windows-virtual-machine-gpu-passthrough-configuration ... figure out which)
    + 'Advanced' {checkbox}
    + 'ROM-Bar:' = {checked}
    + 'PCI-Express:' = {checked}
    + 'Vendor ID:' / 'Device ID:' / 'Sub-Vendor ID:' / 'Sub-Device ID:' = {From Device} (defaults)

## 06.D. Install Windows

This is not detailed on basic Windows 10 installation, but does cover specifics to this VM setup. 

### 06.D.i. Gotchas

*Be aware of these during the installation process:*

* Connect a monitor to your GPU if not done already
* Instructions below are based on Windows 10 21H2 ... text for some items may vary with other versions
* When instructions below say '>_ Console' in the "middle column" it means **don't** use the blue '>_ Console' button in the top-right of the Proxmox UI
    + The middle-column option embeds the viewer in the Proxmox UI window
    + The top-right button uses a pop-up window
        - Install media CD boot option expires quickly
        - On some browsers (at least on my low resolution Debian laptop) the pop-up viewer has an issue the window constantly moves across the screen and if maximized (to stop movement) the screen flashes instead. 
* If you need to restart the VM during install the Proxmox UI can't do a quick "Shutdown" due to the VM not have ACPI or VirtIO active during the installer (this shouldn't be a common problem after initial install is finished)
    + The host is locking the VM
        - Often this is the Proxmox UI / Console viewer for the VM
        - *Giving it time may work* but can go 5-10 minutes before timeout and can still fail
    + If that doesn't work, or you don't want to wait, open a shell to the host as root and:
        - `qm stop 100`
            * Replace 100 with whatever # your VM is on
            * If unsure, `cat /etc/pve/.vmlist` but the same info is in the UI
            * This probably also fails, basically the same as using the UI
        - `fuser /run/lock/qemu-server/lock-100.conf` ... change "100" if needed)
            > /run/lock/qemu-server/lock-200.conf: #####  
          "#####" is a process number, replace in the next 2 lines with the number you get in the command above
        - `ps #####` ... to see what the process is
        - `kill -9 #####` ... be SURE you use the right number here
        - `qm stop 100` ... should work now

### 06.D.ii. Installation

* Start the VM with VNC Console
    + '>_ Console' from the *middle column* (not the button on top-right) of "100 (Win10-VFIO)" in Proxmox UI
        - The main window should say "Guest not running / Start Now"
    + Click 'Start Now'
    + ***Press a key*** *as soon as you see 'Press any key to boot from CD or DVD ..." 
        - This goes away fairly fast (why we don't use the '>_ Console' button on top-right)
        - If it goes away before you press a key, you'll go through network PXE boot followed by an EFI shell. Wait for the EFI shell and do a `reboot`
        - You can optimize boot process in BIOS (`exit` the EFI shell) but it isn't needed as long as you press a key in time during initial boot 
* 'Install Now'
    + 'Which type of installation' = "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" (not "Upgrade:")
    + 'Where do you want to install Windows?' = "Load driver" (no disk detected yet)
    + 'Load Driver' = "OK" (not "Browse", will use the "virtio-win10" ISO)
    + 'Select the driver to install' = "Red Hat VirtIO SCSI controller (D:\amd6w1viostor.inf)" > "Next"
    + 'Where do you want to install Windows?' = "Drive 0 Unallocated Space" > "Next"
    + *Continue Windows installation as normal* ***until:***
        - 'Let's connect you to a network' = "I don't have internet" ... (VirtIO network driver not yet installed)
        - 'There's more to discover wen you connect to the internet' = "Continue with limited setup"
    + *Finish Windows installation as normal*
* Log in to the Windows desktop

### 06.D.iii. VirtIO drivers

VirtIO SCSI driver is already loaded but we still need others.

* *Wizard-based install of multiple drivers at a time*
    + File Explorer > 'This PC' > 'CD Drive (D:) virtio-win'
    + Run (double-click) 'virtio-win-gt-x64'
    + Uncheck any drivers you know you don't want, otherwise leave it 
        - Windows will only load one if needed
        - FYI: "pvpanic", "ivshem" and others may not be signed [per this](https://kevinlocke.name/bits/2021/12/10/windows-11-guest-virtio-libvirt/)
* (at least) 2 devices will need to be updated manually.  
    + **Note:** It might seem like installing the drivers above would install these, but, not working yet
    + **'Red Hat VirtIO Ethernet Adapter'** ... Network adapter (doesn't appear disabled in Device Manager but still isn't working)
        - Windows 'Device Manager' > *'Other devices'*  
            * right-click > 'Update driver'
                + 'Browse my computer for drivers'
                + 'Search for drivers in this location:' = "D:\" 
                + 'Include subfolders' = {checked}
                + 'Next'
            * Networking should come up at this point and 'Device Manager' shows new multiple devices under 'Network adapters'
            * Windows prompts about network discovery in a pop-up, *Allow* (unless you want sharing off)
* Repeat 'Update driver' devices still marked disabled ("!") in 'Device Manager' (I had none)
    + You may not have any devices left once Windows does auto-updates
    + If you passthrough other devices in the future, come back to 'Device Manager' and 'Update drivers'

### 06.D.iv. qemu guest agent and Networking

* File Explorer > 'This PC' > 'CD Drive (D:) virtio-win' > 'guest-agent'
* Run (double-click) 'qemu-ga-x86_64'
* On the host shell run `qm agent 100 ping` (change "100" to your VM # if needed)
    - *No output means it worked*
    - "QEMU guest agent is not running" means it isn't running yet
* **NOTES:** about qemu guest agent 
    + In the Proxmox UI for the VM, go to 'Summary' (middle column) > (Summary widget) and look for the the blue 'More' button
        - if no 'More' button, guest agent isn't working
        - If the 'More' is there, the agent is doing it's job, click it and proceed
* Final networking:
    + 'MAC address'
        - Use on your DHCP server if you want a static lease or a different IP, remember to apply the changes on the DHCP server
        - On my DHCP server I set the hostname for the lease to match my VM name: "Win10-VFIO"
        - On Windows in 'cmd': `ipconfig /release` then `ipconfig /renew` (then `ipconfig` to verify)
        - The Proxmox 'Summary' > 'More' information should automatically update (confirms again the agent works)
    + 'IP address' ... use this later for remote desktop, for my system it is 192.168.3.100

### 06.D.vi. Enable Remote Desktop

* 'Device Manager' > 'System and Security' > 'System' > click 'Allow remote access'
* Ignore 'Allow Remote Assistance' (or uncheck it), that's for MS support to work with you
* 'Remote Desktop' {radio selector} = "Allow remote connections to this computer"
* 'OK'
* Now you should be able to use RDP from another computer to access the Windows VM. Test this first.
     + On another Windows machine
         - run 'Remote Desktop Connection'
         - 'Computer:' = "192.168.3.100" (your VM IP from the previous section)
         - 'Connect'
     + On Linux/etc
         - install and use something like 'remmina'
         - on a Debian Bullseye system, *not the Proxmox host*, a more-than-just-RDP install was:
             `sudo apt install remmina remmina-plugin-rdp remmina-plugin-secret remmina-plugin-spice`
         - `remmina -c rdp://[your username]@192.168.3.100 &` (change to your IP)
     + If one of the above worked, move to the next step where we remove the VNC display

### 06.D.vii. GPU Drivers and remove VM Hardware

**NOTE:** *AMD GPU users:* I don't have help for you here (wish I did). Remove the CD-ROMs as shown below, *pause and find an AMD guide*. Then come back. A [possible starting point](https://blog.quindorian.org/2018/03/building-a-2u-amd-ryzen-server-proxmox-gpu-passthrough.html/). 

* *Nvidia GPU users:* if Internet on 'vmbr1', Windows automatically installs drivers to enable your GPU video with a pop-up announcing Nvidia driver installed
    + If no internet on VM, [get the installer](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) copied to the VM and install
    + My RTX 3080TI *just worked* at this point, no errors.
    + My GTX 1060 (in a different but identical VM) loaded the driver showed in 'Device Manager' as disabled with "Code 43". If you get that, the last 2 sections below fixed it **for me**. 

* Shutdown the VM from Proxmox
* Proxmox UI > 'Datacenter' > [your hostname] > '100(Win10-VFIO)' > 'Hardware' (middle column)
* Remove the ISO images from the VM (can always be added again later)
    + select 'CD/DVD Drive (ide0)' and click blue 'Remove' then 'Yes'
    + select 'CD/DVD Drive (ide2)' and click blue 'Remove' then 'Yes'
* Disable the VNC console
    + **NOTES:** you *can* skip this to leave the VNC console available
        - Useful for easy access from Proxmox (after this change '>_ Console' in Proxmox UI won't work)
        - VNC is seen as another monitor which can be frustrating when using the system normally
        - You still have remote access via RDP without VNC
        - You can add VNC console back to the VM later via changing 'Display' > 'Graphic card:' to "VirtIO-GPU" and restarting
    + select 'Display' and click blue 'Edit' button
    + 'Graphic card:' = "none (none)" ... the GPU will still be on the system
* Set the PCIE GPU to Primary
    + **NOTE:** This wasn't needed for my 3080TI, but was needed for my GTX 1060. As it works with both, I just do it. 
    + select 'PCI Device (hostpci0)' and click blue 'Edit' button
    + 'Graphic card:' = "none (none)" ... the GPU will still be on the system
* *Start the VM* to check if it functions
* If you are still getting "Code 43" errors on an Nvidia GPU:
    + Make sure you disabled VNC in 'Disable the VNC console' *above*, this fixes error 43 quickly on my GTX 1060
    + If that doesn't fix it, this also worked for me (while leaving VNC enabled)
        - (in 'Hardware') select 'PCI Device (hostpci0)' and 'Edit'
        - 'Primary GPU:' = **{checked}**
        - **NOTE:** Checking this allows you to keep the VNC console if you want ('Display' > 'Graphic card:' to "VirtIO-GPU"), but *VNC video* ***won't work***. 
            + It will be weird but keyboard/mouse from the VNC console will work while looking at the GPU monitor. 
            + *RDP is a much better solution in this case* but it's good to know the options.

**IMPORTANT:** At this point you should have Windows GPU drivers working. I had no issues with it on my system and so haven't tested workarounds. 
    + *If you're having problems this is a good point to pause this guide and go figure out that issue.*
    + I didn't need to use a GPU BIOS romfile nor add any args to the qemu config files, but other guides go into details about that. Try [here](https://gist.github.com/qubidt/64f617e959725e934992b080e677656f) if you need to investigate those fixes.
