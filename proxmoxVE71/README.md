**file in progress ... don't use this ... probably don't even read it yet**

I'm posting this for 3 reasons:

* Log what I did in case I need to redo the install later
* Have something others can sanity check for me
* If it's sane, allow other folks to use it like a guide

# Background:

I'm using Proxmox VE 7.1 to then run multiple VMs and containers.
