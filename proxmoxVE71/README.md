# Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS & Gaming VMs - 00 - Introduction

**file in progress ... don't use this ... probably don't even read it yet**

I'm using Proxmox VE 7.1 to then run multiple VMs and containers. These files *should* be a log of everything I did to get my system configured. 

I'm posting is for 3 reasons:

* Log what I did in case I need to redo the install later
* Have something others can sanity check for me
* If it's sane, allow other folks to use it like a guide

## Contents:
> **Hint:** Github has a drop-down automatic TOC, find the **â‰¡** icon on the top-left

* [01. Hardware](01.Hardware.md)
    + Component list
    + RAM Timings
* [02. Proxmox Configuration](02.ProxmoxConfig.md)
    + Notes on drives used
    + Post-install tweaks
