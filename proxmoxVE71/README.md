# Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs - 00 - Introduction

***file in progress ... don't use this ... probably don't even read it yet***

I'm using Proxmox VE 7.1 to then run multiple VMs and containers. These files *should* be a log of everything I did to get my system configured. 

I'm posting is for 3 reasons:

* Log what I did in case I need to redo the install later
* Have something others can sanity check for me
* If it's sane, allow other folks to use it like a guide
