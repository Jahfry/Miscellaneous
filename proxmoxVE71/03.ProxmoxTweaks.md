# Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs - 03 - Proxmox Tweaks

## UI Adjustments

*These are* ***entirely optional*** and modify system files in a way that may be overridden in future updates. In which case you may need to re-apply them. To be 100% safe you can revert these prior to applying updates but that shouldn't be needed. 

I just do these first thing as it makes doing the rest of the admin tasks a bit nicer for me. 

* Dark Mode
    + There isn't an official way to get Dark Mode on your Proxmox UI
    + [PVEDiscordDark](https://github.com/Weilbyte/PVEDiscordDark) works very well and can be easily uninstalled if you don't like it. Use the instructions there, including a shift+reload in your browser, and come back here. 

* Remove the "No Subscription" popups
    + Honestly these are pretty mild popups, but just like Dark Mode, you likely already know you don't have a subscription and if you're using this guide you likely won't be getting one (though it's really nice to me to know I can in the future if needed). 
    + Follow the instructions on [John's Computer Services](https://johnscs.com/remove-proxmox51-subscription-notice/). It includes information on reverting the change if you need later on. You may need to do a shift+reload of your UI after this command.

## Free/non-Subscription Repo

No need to do this if you DO have a subscription. But for the home user this is needed to get updates running. 

* Navigate to 'Datacenter' > [your Proxmox host name] > 'Updates' > 'Repositories'
    + click the line for "https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve" (components has "pve-enterprise") and then click the 'Disable' button
    + click the 'Add' button
