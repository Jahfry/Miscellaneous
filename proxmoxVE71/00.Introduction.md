# Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs - 00 - Introduction

***file in progress ... don't use this ... probably don't even read it yet***

I'm posting is for 3 reasons:

* Log what I did in case I need to redo the install later
* Have something others can sanity check for me
* If it's sane, allow other folks to use it like a guide

If you're configuring a similar system, you might want to start on the Hardware page. I've setup navigation links at the bottom of each page to let you page through each topic. 

If you're here for a specific topic, look through the listing here to find it.
