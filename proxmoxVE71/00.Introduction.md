# Proxmox VE 7.1 NAS and Gaming VMs - 00 - Introduction

***files still in progress ... don't use this ... probably don't even read it yet***

I'm posting is for 3 reasons:

* Log what I did in case I need to redo the install later
* Have something others can sanity check for me
* If it's sane, allow other folks to use it like a guide

If you're configuring a similar system, you might want to start on the Hardware page. I've setup navigation links at the bottom of each page to let you page through each topic. 

If you're here for a specific topic, look through the listing here to find it. 

*These are long pages, geared more towards new users than experts.*

* While I have tested these directions multiple times on fresh installs **on my own system**, *I can't verify everything on* ***your system***. I'm trying to add enough extra information to help you figure out workarounds. 
* If you run into **something wrong**, *please [add an Issue](https://github.com/Jahfry/Miscellaneous/issues)*. This guide may get posted to other sites like Reddit and it will be helpful to not need to track all links. 
* Feel free to ask questions via Issues and I'll answer if I know one.

## Content Map:

**NOTE:** I run my commands in many of these pages logged in as 'root' in a 'bash' shell. If you do something different just know you'll need to modify some commands rather than using directly as copied. Or log in as root and run `bash` before pasting. 

1. If logged in to a non-root user (with permission), `su -` to switch to root (password for this is the root password)
2. If in a different shell, `bash` (I do use bash syntax at times)
