## 01.B. RAM Timings

My system isn't needed to be production-level. I'm more doing this to see about squeezing the max functionality out of my home gaming PC. But I still wanted ECC memory as it is also my NAS. I found the fastest reputable ECC when I was building this to be Kingston 'KSM32ED8/32ME' 3200 sticks. However I have seen a note recently that this product is no longer being made. 

### 01.B.i. Many Warnings:

**NOTE:** ***This is VERY optional***. If you decide to do this, make sure your system is VERY stable before doing anything else. I *don't recommend* you do this, you have to decide.

Just the idea of overclocking ECC RAM on a Proxmox server goes places many Proxmox users may avoid (as does using 4 sticks above 2667 on a 5950X). If you're looking to have the most stability possible, consider not doing this. 

These timings worked on *MY sticks* and *MY motherboard* with days of trial and error. I found other users with the same sticks and we all ended up with slightly different best stable speeds (one person managed 3800, rest seemed to max at 3600, likely due to motherboard differences). And we all ended up needing slightly different timings and voltage to get things stable. 

*Speaking of voltage*, if you're going to up it (and you'll need to if you want to OC above the stock 3200), get heat spreaders. With the heat spreaders I have at <>1.4v on the RAM I don't see over 50C even with long term high workloads. Make sure there is some airflow over your RAM. 

Since the RAM already runs at 3200, if you're worried about stability, just used the JEDEC defaults. 

### 01.B.ii. More Info and Thoughts

* This ECC RAM has **no XMPP profile**, things like the Ryzen DRAM calculator have no benefit.
* Even if you use the same model, your timings may need to be different.
* **IMPORTANT:** be aware that the 5950X is ***only rated for DDR2667*** with **4 sticks** of RAM
    - *If you're doing memory intense usage then consider leaving your RAM at lower timings* ***OR*** *only use 2 sticks, limiting you to 64GB*
    - In my stability testing over a few days I encountered no errors with ECC disabled, so even if a few occur over a long time ECC should correct them ... I wanted the faster gaming VM performance.
* **Do a LOT of stability testing** ... For memory testing my PC was still running Windows but also tested under Linux (Unraid's memory test) and then with many *weeks* of various usage, ***but nothing very stressful yet***.
    + I'm not a memory stability expert, so I'm not going to 'guide' that much. Below are what I used on Windows to test along with other stuff like 'Memtest86+' (if using that on a live USB, you may need to disable EFI booting temporarily). 
    + Initial testing was with PassMark MemTest86 using their .iso on USB. Once I had that passing I ran some other tests. I found that one of the best long-run stability tests was actually to install TrueNAS Scale and do a very large file copy (8TB of mixed content ranging from 1K files up to 20GB+ movies). Doing this had ZFS constantly using the RAM for caching. I caught a number of crashes getting this to work where just running the system normally wouldn't crash at all. You might consider doing a test if you don't already have a better test. 
    + I'm leaving it up to you to find tools to verify your specific overlock, but one tool I found VERY useful if you can run a Windows install:
        - Windows: '[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/)' ...  as a host OS and I grabbed OCCT. I found it valuable enough to pay for a month of use but you can use it free. 
        - Windows: 'HWinfo64' ... ran during tests to make sure my memory temps weren't crazy with increased voltage
        - Windows: I made sure that now WHEA errors were in the Event Viewer during the above tests before considering it stable, both with ECC enabled but more importantly with ECC ***disabled*** in the BIOS during long tests (to keep ECC from hiding any errors). 
    + UPDATE: After a few months I redid my system and found with a newer BIOS the RAM was no longer stable with my original timings and voltage. The list below is my *current* settings.

*If you're going to mess with your memory at this point, you may be putting the rest of the guide down for while until done, but I would recommend getting to what you're happy with before bothering with a lot of system configuration.*

### 01.B.iii. RAM heat spreaders

Since I'm putting more voltage into these, I added thick aluminum heat spreaders 
        - Same as what would come with the Barrow RAMWBT-PA water cooling kit (but without the water block)
        - I bought the spreaders by themselves from Amazon and they were of a good quality ... if you're looking for them they look like this: ![Barrow RAM heat spreader](assets/RAM_heat_spreaders_barrow.jpg)

### 01.B.iv. BIOS Settings

Values in parentheses () are the default on my BIOS.

Any setting in 'Tweaker' > 'Advanced Memory Settings' that isn't shown here is left on defaults "auto". 

* press [DEL] on the BIOS boot screen
* *If you're in 'Easy Mode', switch to 'Advanced' with [F2]**
    + If your BIOS UI is very laggy and it bugs you, press [CONTROL+ALT+F6] to set to a lower resolution. It will be blurrier but much faster if doing a lot of navigation. This may only happen if you disable 'CSM' during the steps below. 
* 'Tweaker'
    + 'System Memory Multiplier' = **36.00** (32.00)
    + 'FCLK Frequency' = **Auto**
    + 'UCLK Mode' = **UCLK==MEMCLK** (Auto)
    + 'DRAM Voltage  (CH A/B)' = **1.370V** (1.200)
        - default is **1.2V**. 1.370 should be long-term safe as long as you watch the heat (see above about heat spreaders I used)
        - Below 1.370V I couldn't reliably POST at 3600
            * on earlier BIOS versions I could at 1.350v with different timings
            * I -can- run this at 1.360v but that's riding the edge, so +.010 for stability
            * Note: X570 is a little squishy on voltages, meaning YOU see 1.370v but the system can go up by .030v, so in reality this is the same as 1.400v on other platforms ... and this is why I wouldn't run it higher if you can't get yours stable at 1.370v or lower. 
        - I did initial timings (below) at 1.5V to make sure I could POST and then tested at lower voltages until deciding on 1.350 *for my specific system*, you'll need to work through an overclocking guide to get yours set.
    + 'Advanced Memory Settings' ... ***If I don't show a specific option in the BIOS timings, it is set to "Auto" (default).***
        - 'Power Down Enable' = **Auto**
        - 'Memory Subtimings'
            * 'CAS Latency' = 18 (22)
            * 'tRCDRD' = 22 (22)
            * 'tRCDWR' = 8 (22)
            * 'tRP' = 18 (16)
            * 'tRAS' = 32 (52)
            * 'tRC' = 52 (74)
            * 'tRFC' = 560 (312) ... Micron 16Gb E-Die chips don't go nearly as low here as Samsung B-Die
            * 'tFAW' = 16 (34)
            * 'Command Rate(tCMD)' = 1T
            * 'Gear Down Mode' = Disabled
    + I didn't change 'CAD Bus Setup Timing' or 'CAD Bus Drive Strength' ... getting these perfect might allow further timing tightening ... I tried some options here but didn't have improvement
