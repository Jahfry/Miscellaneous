## 01.B. RAM Timings

My system doesn't need to be production-stable. I adjust RAM timings to get max performance. 

I still want ECC memory as it is also my NAS. I found the fastest ECC RAM, when building, to be Kingston 'KSM32ED8/32ME' 3200 sticks. *However I have seen a note recently that this product is no longer being made.*

### 01.B.i. Many Warnings:

**NOTE:** ***This is VERY optional***. If you decide to do this, make sure your system **is very stable** before doing Proxmox install. *I don't* ***recommend*** *you do this*, you have to decide.

Overclocking ECC RAM on a Proxmox server goes places many Proxmox admins will avoid (as does using 4 x 32GB sticks above 2667 on a 5950X). If you're looking to have the most stability possible, **don't do this.** 

These timings work on *MY sticks* and *MY motherboard after* ***days of trial and error***. Other users with the same sticks ended up with different best stable speeds (one person managed 3800, most maxed at 3600). To get things stable *we all needed different timings and voltage* ***even with matching motherboard and RAM models.***

***Regarding voltage***, if you're need to raise it to OC above stock 3200, **so get heat spreaders**. With heat spreaders at <>1.4v on RAM I don't see over 50C on long term high-loads. *Make sure there is airflow over your RAM.* 

*if you're worried about stability, since this RAM already runs at speedy 3200, just use the JEDEC defaults.* Ryzen *likes* 3600+ but 3200 is still a very good speed. Keep your Infinity Fabric at 1:1 even if you stay at 3200.

### 01.B.ii. More Info and Thoughts

* This RAM has **no XMPP profile**, things like Ryzen DRAM calculator have no benefit
* Even if you use the same model, your timings may need to be different.
* **IMPORTANT:** be aware that the 5950X is ***only rated for DDR2667*** with **4 sticks** of RAM
    - *If you have constant* ***intense*** *use choose the slower speed* ***OR*** *only use 2 sticks, (limiting to 64GB)*
    - In my testing I encountered no errors with ECC disabled to avoid hiding errors from the overclock ... if a few occur over a longer time ECC on should compensate (turn ECC on after testing)
* **Do a LOT of stability testing** ... For memory testing I tested on both Windows and Linux *with weeks of various usage* before deciding it was OK for my storage system. I'm not a memory stability expert, so I'm not going to 'guide' here, but here are some tests used:
    + MemTest86 using .iso USB ... takes over a day for finishing passes
    + TrueNAS Scale and doing a very large file copies
	    + 8TB of mixed content ranging from 1K files up to 20GB+ movies
	    + ZFS constantly used 50% RAM in ARC
	    + Caught a number of crashes getting the copy to run more than a few minutes where just running the system normally wouldn't crash at all
	+ Proxmox install .iso on USB 'memtest86+' (requires booting the USB in legacy mode) ... takes over a day to do 4 passes
    * '[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/)' (in Windows 10) ... can use free but was worth paying for 1 month to get some extra features
    * 'HWinfo64' (in Windows 10) ... ran during tests to make sure my memory temps weren't crazy with increased voltage
	- Windows 10: verified no WHEA errors in 'Event Viewer' during the above OCCT tests, both with ECC ***disabled*** in BIOS (to keep ECC from hiding any errors). 
    + UPDATE: After a few months I found a newer BIOS F36b was no longer stable with my original timings and voltage. The list below are *current* settings.

*If you're going to mess with your memory at this point, you may be putting the rest of the guide down for while until done. Get to what speed/stability you're happy with before bothering with a lot of system configuration.*

### 01.B.iii. RAM heat spreaders

Since I'm putting more voltage into these, I added thick aluminum heat spreaders 
        - Same as what would come with the Barrow RAMWBT-PA water cooling kit (but without the water block)
        - I bought the spreaders by themselves from Amazon and they were of a good quality ... if you're looking for them they look like this: ![Barrow RAM heat spreader](assets/RAM_heat_spreaders_barrow.jpg)

### 01.B.iv. BIOS Timing Settings

*Optional:* These are settings important to getting best RAM performance. Items needed for installing Proxmox are on the next page. 

Values in parentheses () are the default on my BIOS.

Any setting in 'Tweaker' > 'Advanced Memory Settings' that isn't shown here is left on defaults "auto". 

* Boot the server
* Press {DEL} key on the BIOS splash screen
* *If you're in 'Easy Mode', switch to 'Advanced' with [F2]**
	* If input is delayed/slow, press {Control} + {Alt} + {F6} to use a lower resolutio
	* It will be blurrier but much more responsive
* 'Save & Exit'
	* *Recommended: "Save Profiles"* 
		- Anything already working at this point is saved in case of problems
		- Name up to you
	* *Recommended: "Load Optimized Default"*
		- Will make sure you're starting with similar settings to what I began with
		- We'll adjust things needed for Proxmox to install on the next page
		- Can use the saved profile if you need to get back to prior state
* 'Tweaker'
    + 'System Memory Multiplier' = **"36.00"** (32.00)
    + 'FCLK Frequency' = **"Auto"**
    + 'UCLK Mode' = **"UCLK == MEMCLK"** (Auto)
    + 'DRAM Voltage  (CH A/B)' = **"1.370V"** (1.200)
        - default is **1.2V**. 1.370v should be long-term safe as long as heat mitigate (see above for heat spreaders used)
        - Below 1.370V I couldn't reliably POST at 3600
            * on earlier BIOS versions I could at 1.350v with different timings
            * I -can- POST at 1.360v but unstable once booted, +.010 for stability
            * **NOTE:** X570 is a wishy-washy on voltages, meaning YOU set 1.370v but the system dynamically goes up another .030v under load, so 1.37v is like 1.4v on other platforms. 
        - Initial timings (below) used 1.5V to make sure I could POST and then tested at lower voltages until deciding on 1.370v *for my specific sticks*, you'll need to work through an overclocking guide to get yours set if these don't work.
    + 'Advanced Memory Settings' ... ***If I don't show a specific option in the BIOS timings, it is set to "Auto" (default).***
        - 'Power Down Enable' = **"Auto"**
        - 'Memory Subtimings'
            * 'CAS Latency' = "18" (22)
            * 'tRCDRD' = "22" (22)
            * 'tRCDWR' = "8" (22)
            * 'tRP' = "18" (16)
            * 'tRAS' = "32" (52)
            * 'tRC' = "52" (74)
            * 'tRFC' = "560" (312) ... Micron 16Gb E-Die chips don't go nearly as low here as Samsung B-Die
            * 'tFAW' = "16" (34)
            * 'Command Rate(tCMD)' = "1T"
            * 'Gear Down Mode' = "Disabled"
		    + *Didn't change 'CAD Bus Setup Timing' or 'CAD Bus Drive Strength' ... getting perfect might allow further timing tightening ... tried some but no improvement*
* 'Save & Exit'
	* *Recommended:* "Save Profiles"  ... create a new profile
	* "Save & Exit Setup" (system will reboot)
